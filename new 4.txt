Yes, you can configure your Raspberry Pi to allow connections without requiring a pairing code or manual interaction. This involves setting up the Raspberry Pi to act as a Bluetooth server and accept connections from other devices without user intervention. Hereâ€™s how you can achieve this:

1. Configure Bluetooth on Raspberry Pi
First, ensure that Bluetooth is enabled and properly configured on your Raspberry Pi. You can do this via the command line or using GUI tools like bluetoothctl.

bash
Copy code
sudo bluetoothctl
Inside bluetoothctl, you can enable Bluetooth (power on), make the device discoverable (discoverable on), and set a Bluetooth pin code (pairable on and set pin <your-pin>).

2. Edit Bluetooth Configuration File
Edit the Bluetooth configuration file on your Raspberry Pi to allow connections without requiring a pairing code. This file is usually located at /etc/bluetooth/main.conf.

bash
Copy code
sudo nano /etc/bluetooth/main.conf
Find and edit the following lines:

conf
Copy code
[Bluetooth]
...
# Enables MultiProfile support. This allows multiple applications to connect to a service
# at the same time. Defaults to true.
MultiProfile = off
...
# Default PIN code.
# In case the controller doesn't provide one, it tries to use 1234. Nevertheless, if
# it provides one, then it tries that one first.
# It uses bluez pin helper by default, if no other pin helper is available.
# Default: "1234"
#PinCode = 1234
...
# By default, for incoming connections, a PIN code is required. Setting
# this to no disables PIN authentication.
PairableTimeout = 0
Set MultiProfile = off to MultiProfile = on and #PinCode = 1234 to PinCode = 1234.

3. Restart Bluetooth Service
Restart the Bluetooth service on your Raspberry Pi to apply the changes:

bash
Copy code
sudo systemctl restart bluetooth
